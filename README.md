Domain Migration Toolkit for IT Technicians


Hiiiii This is a readme file which is apparently good practice for those that come later and read your code. it can include instructions for download and setup, or important annoucements about the code.


Feyza! if you are reading this, type something down below :)

Hi Alex! Thanks for invitation. I'm very excited about this project!

Great, what is the next step?

this is where i would make edits. i like how my editor highlights the changes on the left (green line) which are NEW and not yet pushed to the repository. if youre reading this on the git website, or on your local version, that means this edit was successfully pushed! 

yeah finally, I found it to edit readme :)

what do you think to create next? in my mind 4 steps 1- pre-migration 2- doing migration troubleshooting 3- post- migration 4-  Another troubleshooting steps. What do you think?
